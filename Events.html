                          <p class="title"> ABOUT THE ARTIST</p>
                           <p>It’s a readymade canvas both epic and contained. An Australian flag, clearly a little worse for wear. It’s huge - large enough to have once flown above Parliament House in Canberra, the very epicentre of the political nation. This gives it its own public life, a singular object’s history that is also wrapped up in the history of our federated, young nation. Expansive in scale, this object also provides a conceptual boundary, a historical and political framing that lends symbolic weight to Richard Lewer’s intervention.
