<h2> Fiona Hooton</h2>
<p class="title"> Jul 20, 2020</p>
<h3>The Work</h3>
 <p>The ziggurat references, the Capitol building planned by American architects,  Marion Mahony Griffin and Walter Burley Griffin in 1911. The Capitol was to be sited on the city’s highest hill, Kurrajong [where Parliament House is  today]. 
     
                It was to be a potent symbol of democracy and the pinnacle of the Griffin’s Federal Capital plan. Placed above parliament, it was an apolitical building celebrating the achievements of citizens. Designed at a time when Australia’s newly created democracy was inspiring the rest of the world in women’s rights and industrial relations. 
                     
                The idea of progressive new lands was a shared American and Australian conceit. Indigenous peoples in both countries were usually excluded, as noncitizens, from voting at all. 
                     
                2020 is the centenary of women winning the right to vote in the U.SA, the 19th Constitutional Amendment. Marion and her mother Clara Perkins Mahony were both lifelong leaders in the campaign for women’s rights.  
                
<h3> ABOUT THE ARTIST </h3>
                
                As an  artist and arts worker, Fiona is interested in what is and isn’t  memorialised. Her work includes large-scale events and festival installations as well as permanent and ephemeral public artworks and exhibitions. Recent work combines her interests in place, public art and audiences, while exploring the possibilities of urban play for creative, political and public interventions.

<h2>Jacqueline Bradley</h2>
<p class="title"> JULY 15, 2020 </p>
<h3>The Work</h3>
<p>In Precedent, a linear, articulated structure of fabric, timber, cement and brass moves along the busy pathways around Lake Burley Griffin. This malleable and mobile structure makes its slow, awkward journey between the bridges, aided by the iterative movements of two performers. Borrowing from the language of fitness training regimes, these performers climb the work along the pathways in tandem, each pushing the other to advance the piece a   little further along the thoroughfare.
     
                Precedent relies on incremental changes in the performer’s repetitive movements in order for the sculptural structure to travel from place to place. The sculpture echoes the formal qualities of the architecture between   the bridges, the stand of flag poles and the curve of the concrete path. The   lake is a site is heavy with histories built up over time, and changed through slow, deliberate movement. Meaningful change is not fast; it is performed over years through accrual of actions made collectively and individually. Precedent explores these ideas through embodied, temporal practice, adaptive structures and leg warmers.
</p>
<h3> ABOUT THE ARTIST </h3>
<p> Jacqueline Bradley is an artist concerned with bodily relationships to the outdoors. Through her wearable and sculptural constructions, she explores the ways in which clothing and equipment both reflect and influence an experience of a landscape.  Bradley has exhibited and collaborated with artists and curators in Australia and internationally, and worked with national parks staff and landscape architects on projects regarding performance in the landscape in Canada and Australia. In recent years, she has developed projects for the National Portrait Gallery, the Drill Hall Gallery and the South Australian touring exhibition I’m a feminist, but… In early 2019 Jacqueline was funded by Arts ACT and the Australian Embassy in Washington to exhibit works from her PhD series Am I doing this right? and to develop and construct a large artwork on at the Embassy Gallery in Washington. Her work was recently discussed in Columbia Universities Climates: Architecture and the Planetary Imaginary, and she is currently working on a new project for the Unsolicited Proposals Unit, curated by Eleanor Scicchitano. She works from her backyard studio and lectures at the National Art School.

<h2>Louise Weaver</h2>
<p class="title"> JULY 6, 2020 </p>
<h3>The Work</h3>
<p>Louise Weaver’s multidisciplinary practice employs an assortment of media in the creation of both individual works and expansive sculptural installations that centre around the natural world. The paintings, sculptures and environments that Weaver creates interact with a broad range of themes. Weaver has a fascination with metamorphosis, cycles of growth and the intricacies of camouflage. Her work plays with these concepts and extends them into ideas surrounding artificiality,

                transformation, social themes and feminism, underpinned by the enduring power of mythology, make-believe and memory. Highly propositional, her works are imaginative and exquisite objects, tableaux, constellations and fields for contemplation. Through the intricate traceries, patterns, webs and nets that appear and reappear throughout her practice, Weaver suggests a complex interconnected universe of fragile beauty that comprises things real and imagined, fleeting and eternal.
</p>
<h3> ABOUT THE ARTIST </h3>
<p>Weaver has held numerous Individual Exhibitions including:   Between Appearances: The art of Louise Weaver curated by Melissa Keys, Buxton   Contemporary, The University of Melbourne, 2019 – 2020; Behind the scenes,   Darren Knight Gallery, Sydney, 2019; The Kind That Gives Body To Words,   Darren Knight Gallery, Sydney (2017).

<h2>Franck Gohier</h2>
<p class="title"> JUNE 15, 2020 </p>
<h3>The Work</h3>
<p>The implementation of the neoliberal paradigm 'greed is good' in the 80's has not served the people,the environment, the economy or the country. There is no 'trickle down effect'. There are no 'crumbs from the table'. The neoliberals abhorrent avarice and self interest, their deregulation and tax cuts to themselves has virtually destroyed public services, social security and unions. There is enough to go around for   everyone and I want my children to be given the same opportunities I had...from a level playing field.
</p>
<h3> ABOUT THE ARTIST </h3>
<p>Franck Gohier is a painter, sculptor and printmaker based in Darwin. His punchy, immediate style, utilising bright colours, text and popular imagery belies his works' deeper messages, drawn from a keen interest in politics and social justice instilled since childhood.

<h2>Kael Stasce</h2>
<p class="title"> JUNE 15, 2020 </p>
<h3>The Work</h3>
<p>Kael Stasce is concerned with the ways in which we view and understand space through constructing abstract sculptures and assemblages. The aim of his practice is to explore the relationship between visual perception and physical experience when viewing works of art. One by One is a work that actively involves the surroundings as a formal element to the composition, using the site as a motif that directly influences and mimics the construction of the art work. Using the concept of line, the three-dimensional elements allow the work to transform the experience of space, creating a composition that produces bold and dynamic shifts both physically and as an illusion. 
</p>
<h3> ABOUT THE ARTIST </h3>
 <p>Kael Stasce has completed Bachelor of Visual Arts Honours degree at the Australian National University in 2014.

<h3>The Work</h3>
<p>‘Gumleaf Regatta’ (2020) is a dream-like interpretation of Lake Burley Griffin, exploring the theme of transportation through floating, and includes representations of various layers of society, including Indigenous culture, pioneer history, and politics.

<h2>Glen Hayward</h2>
<p class="title"> JUNE 15, 2020 </p>
<h3>The Work</h3>
<p> At different moments in the fabrication of any artwork I love the openness and I love the ability to demand remarkable things from my work. As I move closer to exhibiting the work, the companion in my head that follows me throughout my day; of surfaces/textures and a patchwork of what I am doing and what I am   trying to achieve, disappears. My relationship moves closer towards you and yet I can't quite inhabit the space you do and I am full of hope for what you will gain from the experience. My partner thought it would be helpful for me to tell you I think the tree has a quality similar to our own at this moment because it is pollarded. The lumpen limbs seem to fill with energy as its extensions into the world were removed and used for firewood or chipped. I have watched us come out of lockdowns and heard our struggles to articulate   our experiences and I wish to extend my sympathy.

<h2>Ham Darroch</h2>
<p class="title"> JUNE 15, 2020 </p>
<h3>The Work</h3>
<P>For Contour 2020 I am proposing to document Canberra in a performance walk. Beginning on Aspen Island below the Carillion and walking a loop of the lake, taking in a great deal of the city. This will be the second Slow Walk performance which comes from a series I have worked on since 2008, beginning in London. For the walk I will be pulling an altered upright piano attached to a cart. The harp of the piano has a series of plumb bobs attached to it which strike the exposed strings to create a musical documentation of the contours of the pavement or path. The sculpture in effect plays the pavement. The piece is recorded within the piano and can be exhibited with the sculpture and photographs in my absence. I will encourage some involvement from viewers who would be willing to walk some of the site with me and strike an occasional note. It would be wonderful to take the contour community of artists and viewers on a musical walk.  Beginning at the Carillion, a gift from the UK has a link to the piano which was gifted to me in the UK. Also conceptually the Carillion speaks of the shape of sound, reverberation and repetition. The shape of sound has long been considered most famously by the artist John Cage who has written compositions for Carillions.
</P>
<h3> ABOUT THE ARTIST </h3>
<p>Ham   Darroch is an Australian artist working in sculpture, performance and  drawing. His sculptures are created from existing objects which are altered   and redirected using colour to reveal new meanings. His paintings are   inspired by the action of everyday objects. His imagery is universal evoking   shared histories and experiences, place and perception while revealing a deep   sensitivity to the optical effects of geometric colour. In early 2006, he   completed an MFA (research) COFA UNSW and in 1997 a Bachlor of Arts from ANU.   From 2006 he has worked as an assistant to Bridget Riley.

<h2>Grace Blake</h2>
<p class="title"> JUNE 2, 2020 </p>
<h3>The Work</h3>
<p>Typical of most of my work, this series is informed by my innate human tendency for biophilic and techno curious speculation. Branching out into more formalised sculptural work, these constructions are designed as small scale architectural experiments, that hybridise forms from anthropods and flora and structural building techniques. These forms are small enough to remain sculptural art objects, yet are large enough to create microclimates and impact the natural process of their direct surrounds. The series was inspired by the Sanzhi Pod city in Twainwan, an abandoned futuristic holiday village that came to house a specialised biodome only discovered within the pod city upon its demolition. 
</p>
<h3> ABOUT THE ARTIST </h3>
<p>Grace Blake is a digital media and installation artist base in Canberra. Central to her practice is a tension between the virtual and tangible, which is developed by using 3D modelling and editing software to generate hypothetical architecture and objects, which are increasingly placed within accompanying installations. Recently, her works look to establish a common thread connecting ancient and future organic, artificial and hybridised life on earth, a commonality between human and nonhuman beings. Blake’s artworks act to extrapolate a near post anthopeance future where human ruins house a new life, a world populated hi-tech and ambiguous objects.  Blake strives to craft a speculative reality and examine what is compelling about creating science fiction futures.

<h3>The Work</h3>
<p>Isolated in individual cabinets throughout the King O'Malleys Irish Pub, the Canberra Symphony Orchidstra consists of several ceramic orchids playing classical music. Whilst we've been in lockdown the natural world has carried on, and as we slowly return to busyness this piece is a gentle reminder for us to continue listening to what   nature has to say.
</p>
